<span style="font-size: 28px; font-family: 'Geogrotesque Trial', sans-serif; "><strong>About Me</strong></span>

I am a 1<sup>st</sup> year Political Science Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I work on international relations, comparative politics, and political methodology. 

I previously received my masterâ€™s degree in Political Science from the Central European University and I completed my B.A. in International Relations at the Bilkent University. Before starting my graduate studies at the UNC, I worked as a project assistant at the International Centre for Migration Policy Development for two years.
