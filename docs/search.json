I work on international relations and political methodology. My main research interests are (i) analyzing the repertoire of violence used by militant actors to understand how group hierarchies and compositions influence their strategic decisions and (ii) how political factors and institutions lead violent groups to commit politically-oriented violent attacks.\nI previously received my master’s degree in Political Science from Central European University and I completed my B.A. in International Relations at Bilkent University. Before starting my graduate studies at UNC, I worked as a project assistant at the International Centre for Migration Policy Development for two years.\nIf you would like to contact me, please feel free to reach out via ozkaraca[at]unc.edu."

    "text": "Checking assumptions with real-world data\nAfter introducing the main premises of ANOVA test and the dataset, let’s go over whether the ANOVA test we will be pursuing satisfies the main assumptions.\nBeginning with Variable Type, we have a single continuous quantitative dependent variable (DV), number of terror events for each country annually, and a qualitative independent variable (IV) with a minimum of two levels, the level of economic inequality. So, Variable Type assumption is satisfied ✅.\nWith regards to the Independence, the events in our dataset are independent from the each other as it is not high likely that number of terror events in one country affects another and etc. So, Independence assumption is satisfied ✅.\nTo check Normality assumption, there are two ways, either a visual inspection or a statistical test. The below panel tab shows both.\n\nHistogramShapiro Test\n\n\n\nhist(dataset$count)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshapiro.test(dataset$count)\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  dataset$count\nW = 0.31233, p-value &lt; 0.00000000000000022\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a p-value below 0.05 as a result of the Shapiro test, we can reject the null hypothesis that the data follows a normal distribution.

In this case, category of athletes will be our qualitative independent variable (IV) with a minimum of two levels, . So, Variable Type assumption is satisfied ✅.\nWith regards to the Independence, the events in our dataset are independent from the each other as they are the result of each individual competation. So, Independence assumption is also satisfied ✅.\nTo check Normality assumption, there are two ways, either a visual inspection or a statistical test. Because the sample size for the dependent variable is higher than 5000 and therefore it is above the limit for the shapiro test, I will choose to stick with the visual inspection. The below figure demonstrates the distribution for the dependent variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen from the figure, the dependent variable follows a slightly normal distribution, in addition to the fact that we have a large sample size in here, we can accept the null hypothesis that he data follows a normal distribution and normality assumption is met ✅.\nWith a p-value below 0.05 as a result of the Shapiro test, we can reject the null hypothesis that the data follows a normal distribution.
