<span style="font-size: 28px; font-family: 'Geogrotesque Trial', sans-serif; "><strong>About Me</strong></span>

I am a **PhD student in the Department of Political Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**. I work on **international relations** and **political methodology**. My main research interests are (i) *analyzing the repertoire of violence used by militant actors to understand how group hierarchies and compositions influence their strategic decisions* and (ii) *how political factors and institutions lead violent groups to commit politically-oriented violent attacks*.

I previously received my **masterâ€™s degree in Political Science from Central European University** and I completed my **B.A. in International Relations at Bilkent University**. Before starting my graduate studies at UNC, I **worked as a project assistant at the International Centre for Migration Policy Development** for two years.

If you would like to contact me, please feel free to reach out via ozkaraca[at]unc.edu.
